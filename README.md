# Homework 6 - Dimension Reduction and Fast Exponential Transform

In this homework, you will find the questions in [answers.ipynb](answers.ipynb).  This is convenient for displaying math equations. You can use [answers.ipynb](answers.ipynb) for written answers and running simulations/displaying plots.

You can run
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
to install the packages in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). Furthermore, you should install additional packages if needed in your answers file even if the packages are not contained within requirements.txt.

### Grading Rubric

The following rubric will be used for grading.

|  | Total |
|:-:|:-:|
| Problem 0 | /45 |
| Problem 1 | /30 |

Correctness will be based on code (i.e. did you provide was was asked for) and the content of [`answers.ipynb`](answers.ipynb). Make sure to back up any arguments made with scientifically rigorous results and arguments.

To get full points on style you should use comments to explain what you are doing in your code and write docstrings for your functions. In other words, make your code readable and understandable. Furthermore, use appropriate variable names, e.g. not too long but descriptive.

### Autograder

There is no autograder.
